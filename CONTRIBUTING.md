## Donations

due_date is an open source project that I maintain in my free time. If you find it useful, donations are greatly appreciated!

### Why Donate?

Your donations allow me to spend more time maintaining and improving the package:

- Responding to issues
- Reviewing pull requests
- Adding new features
- Writing documentation
- Updating dependencies

Without donations, I need to limit my time spent based on what I can fit around other priorities in life.

### Making a Donation

If you're interested in donating to support due_date development, you can do so via:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/fmorschel) - Recurring or one-time payments
- [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fmorschel) - One-time payments

All donations are greatly appreciated! Every bit helps justify more time spent on open source work.

## Using Donations

Donations help provide financial support but do not influence due_date's roadmap or feature priorities. Bug fixes and maintenance tasks always take priority.

The majority of donations fund my time spent coding, documenting, reviewing, and responding to the community.

I commit to being fully transparent about how donations are used to sustain development. Please feel free to ask questions!
